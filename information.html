       <h1 class="display-4">SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES</h1>
       <hr>
       <h5>What are STDs?</h5>
         <p>STDs/STIs are a group of illnesses that are passed from person to person during sexual intercourse, oral sex, or certain types of sex play. These diseases can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites and are spread through intimate sexual contact involving the penis, vagina, mouth, or anus or contact with any of the membranes that line the urinary and/or genital tracts. STDs/STIs are also called venereal diseases.</p>
       <br>
       <h5>What are common symptoms of STDS?</h5>
       <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
         <li class="list-group-item-black">Unusual discharge from the penis or vagina</li>
         <li class="list-group-item-black">Sores or warts on the genital area</li>
         <li class="list-group-item-black">Painful or frequent urination</li>
         <li class="list-group-item-black">Itching and redness in the genital area</li>
         <li class="list-group-item-black">Blisters or sores in or around the mouth</li>
         <li class="list-group-item-black">Abnormal genital odor</li>
         <li class="list-group-item-black">Anal itching, soreness, or bleeding</li>
         <li class="list-group-item-black">Abdominal pain</li>
         <li class="list-group-item-black">Fever</li>
       </ul>
         <p>However, plenty of people with STDs experience none of the above symptoms, so it is necessary to get tested regularly even if your health is not abnormal.</p>
       <br>
       <h5>How are STDs diagnosed?</h5>
         <p>Some STDs/STIs may be diagnosed during a physical exam or through microscopic examination of a sore or fluid swabbed from the vagina, penis, or anus. This fluid can also be cultured over a few days to see whether infectious bacteria or yeast can be detected. The effects of human papilloma virus (HPV), which causes genital warts and cervical cancer, can be detected in a woman when her health care provider performs a pap smear test and takes samples of cells from the cervix to be checked microscopically for abnormal changes. Blood tests are used to detect infections such as hepatitis A, B, and C or HIV/AIDS.</p>
       <br>
       <h5>How are STDs treated?</h5>
       <p>STDs/STIs caused by bacteria or parasites can be treated with antibiotics. These antibiotics are most often given by mouth (orally). However, sometimes they are injected or applied directly to the affected area. The treatments, complications, and outcomes for viral STIs depend on the particular virus (HIV, genital herpes, human papillomavirus, hepatitis, or cytomegalovirus). Treatments can reduce the symptoms and the progression of most of these infections. For example, medications are available to limit the frequency and severity of genital herpes outbreaks while reducing the risk that the virus will be passed on to other people.</p>

       <h1 class="display-4">MENSTRUATION</h1>
       <hr>
       <h5>What is menstruation?</h5>
       <p>The menstrual cycle is the monthly hormonal cycle that a person with a uterus's body goes through to prepare for pregnancy. Your menstrual cycle is counted from the first day of one's period up to the first day of one's next period. Hormone levels (estrogen and progesterone) usually change throughout the menstrual cycle and can cause menstrual symptoms.</p>
       <br>
       <h5>What is ovulation?</h5>
       <p>Ovulation is when the ovary releases an egg so it can be fertilized by a sperm in order to make a baby. A person is most likely to get pregnant if they have sex without birth control in the three days before and up to the day of ovulation (since the sperm are already in place and ready to fertilize the egg as soon as it is released). Sperm can live for 3 to 5 days in reproductive organs, but an ovulating person's egg lives for just 12 to 24 hours after ovulation.
         Each person's cycle length may be different, and the time between ovulation and when the next period starts can be anywhere from one week (7 days) to more than 2 weeks (19 days).</p>

       <h1 class="display-4">ABORTION</h1>
       <hr>
       <h5>Abortion Types</h5>
       <ol class="list-group list-group-flush">
         <li class="list-group-item-black">Medication abortion</li>
           <ul>
             <li>Medication abortion (also known as the abortion pill) consists of using two different medicines called mifepristone and misoprostol to end a pregnancy.</li>
             <li>A doctor or nurse will give detailed directions about where, when, and how to take the medicines. Antibiotics may also be given to prevent infection. This medicine causes cramping and bleeding to empty your uterus. The process is very similar to an early miscarriage.</li>
             <li>In most states, the abortion pill can only be taken up to 10 weeks after the first day of your last period. If you’re past 10 weeks, you can still get an in-clinic abortion.</li>
